# My Dream Passport

## Description:

Our team wanted to create an application that tracks your travel destinations- past, present, and future! Use My Dream Passport to log your adventures. Store where you traveled, when you traveled, and your rating of the destination. Then, fill in some highlights of the journey. You can also log your future travel desinations. Tell us where you want to go, when you want to go, if you want to go within the next year, and a little bit about what you want to do when you get there! Easily view and edit you past and future travel destinations all in one place.
